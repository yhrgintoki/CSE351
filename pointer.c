You will provide your solution to this homework by
editing the collection of functions in this source file.

INTEGER CODING RULES:

  Replace the "return" statement in each function with one
  or more lines of C code that implements the function. Your code
  must conform to the following style:

  int Funct(arg1, arg2, ...) {
      /* brief description of how your implementation works */
      int var1 = Expr1;
      ...
      int varM = ExprM;

      varJ = ExprJ;
      ...
      varN = ExprN;
      return ExprR;
  }

  Each "Expr" is an expression using ONLY the following:
  1. Integer constants 0 through 255 (0xFF), inclusive. You are
     not allowed to use big constants such as 0xffffffff.
     However you are allowed to add constants to values greater
     than 255. e.g. 250+250 = 500.
  2. Function arguments and local variables (no global variables).
  3. For 1-3, only use the following:
     Pointer operations '*' and  '&'. (Note that these are only for
     dereferencing and taking addresses, bitwise & is not allowed).
     Binary integer operations - + *.
     Unary integer operation !.
     For the last three, you may also use shifts (<<, >>), ~, ==, and ^.

  Some of the problems restrict the set of allowed operators even further.
  Each "Expr" may consist of multiple operators. You are not restricted to
  one operator per line.

  You are expressly forbidden to:
  1. Use any control constructs such as if, do, while, for, switch, etc. (unless
     otherwise stated).
  2. Define or use any macros.
  3. Define any additional functions in this file.
  4. Call any functions (unless otherwise stated).
  5. Use any other operations, such as &&, ||, ?:, sizeof,
     != or binary (bitwise & or |)
  6. Use the [] operator to index into arrays for reading or writing.

  You may assume that your machine:
  1. Uses 2s complement, 32-bit representations of integers.
  2. Performs right shifts arithmetically.
  3. Has *undefined* behavior when shifting by a negative amount or an amount
     greater than or equal to the number of bits in the value being shifted.
     e.g. For x >> n, shifts by n < 0 or n >= *size of x* are undefined
     e.g. if x is a 32-bit int, shifts by >= 32 bits are undefined
     Undefined means you do not know what result you will get from the operation.
